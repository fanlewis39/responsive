			<h2>The art of reinvention</h2>
			<p>From Hamburg to Abu Dhabi, local authorities and investors are pumping money into new museums, concert halls, and galleries to revitalise communities, encourage cultural exchanges, and bring a new lease of life – and revenue stream – to previously overlooked regions.</p>

			<p>The sun has cracked the shell of the desert night. It’s not even 9 a.m. but the temperature is already nudging 35 degrees Celsius. I’ve never felt cooler, though. I’m enjoying the breeze that wisps under the vast silver parasol of the most striking new art gallery and the best new building in the Middle East, if not the world: the GBP 3 billion Louvre Abu Dhabi.</p>
			<p>The first overseas ‘branch’ of the world’s most storied museum that opened in November 2017 is the boldest bet any modern city state has made on the appeal and value of art. The Guggenheim Bilbao, which transformed a once-sleepy Basque town into a stop on Europe’s grand tour when it opened 21 years ago, cost a seventh as much and was completed in half the time.</p>
			<p>It was Frank Gehry’s swooping metallic gift to Spain that kick-started a renaissance in urban cultural investment that has spread to almost every city. London’s once abandoned Bankside Power Station and the surrounding riverbank area have been given a new lease of life by the Tate Modern. I. M. Pei’s Museum of Islamic Art in Doha has done more to put Qatar on the global map than any other institution, and it has been followed by new museums, galleries, and libraries designed by Dutch master Rem Koolhaas and Jean Nouvel (yes, that Pritzker Prize-winning Frenchman is all over the Gulf).</p>
